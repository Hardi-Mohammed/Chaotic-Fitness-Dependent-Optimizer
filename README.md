%CFDO  is an improvement in FDO
%which includes different chaotic maps  to improve the performance of FDO , 
%the results shows that CFDO is better than FDO and other popular algorithms in 10  benchmark functions.

% % we improved the code of FDO which have been written by Jaza Abdulla % % then we embeded chaotic maps. % %%

# How it works:<br>
 You only need to Run the main.m using matlab software then you can see the results by running the main file CFDO runs 30 time ( each time includes 500 iterations) Results prints 30 best_Score and then shows the average of them all files must be in the same directory.
